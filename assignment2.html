<font size="4pts" color="orange">If people lie to me they are poorer,not I</font><br>
 <font size="4pts" color="violet">Persome:</font>
<font size="4pts" color="saffron">But it is ridiculous;you will soon have nothing left.You give away everything, everything!!!</font><br>
<font size="4pts" color="green">Bishop:</font>

 <font size="4pts" color="violet">Persome:</font>
<font size="4pts" color="saffron">You are like achild.I can't trust you out of  my sight.No sooner is my back turned than you get that little minx marie to sell the sillver salt cellars</font><br>
<font size="4pts" color="green">Bishop(rising):</font>
<font size="4pts" color="orange">Ah,yes, the salt cellars.It is a pity.You--you were proud of them!</font><br>
 <font size="4pts" color="violet">Persome:</font>
<font size="4pts" color="saffron">Proud of them!Why, they have been in our family for years.</font><br>
<font size="4pts" color="green">Bishop:</font>
<font size="4pts" color="orange">Yes,it is a pity.They were beautiful;but still,dear,one can eat salt out of China just as well</font><br>
 <font size="4pts" color="violet">Persome:</font>
<font size="4pts" color="saffron">Yes,or meat off the floor,I suppose .Oh,it's coming to that.And as for that old wretch,Mere Gringoire,I wonder she had the audacity to send here again. The last time I saw her I gave her such a talking to that it ought to have had some effect.</font><br>
<font size="4pts" color="green">Bishop:</font>
<font size="4pts" color="orange">Yes! I offered to take her in here for a day or two but she seemed to think it might distress you.</font><br>

<font size="4pts" color="saffron">You had to pay it.<i>(Gesture of comic despair)</i></font><br>
<font size="4pts" color="green">Bishop:</font>
<font size="4pts" color="orange">yes, and you see I had not money, so i had to dispose of the salt cellars.It was fortune I had them.Wasn't it?(smiling).But I'm sorry I hhave grieved you.</font><br>
 <font size="4pts" color="violet">Persome:</font>
<font size="4pts" color="saffron">Oh,go on!Go on! you are incorrigible. You'll sell your candlesticks next.</font><br>

<font size="4pts" color="saffron">Oh why not? They will pay somebody's rent.I suppose. </font><br>
<font size="4pts" color="green">Bishop:</font>
<font size="4pts" color="orange">Ah, you are good sister , to think of that but--I don't want to sell them.You see,my mother gave them to me on--on her death-bed just after you are born and--and she asked me to keep them in remembrance of her, so I would  liikw them, but perhaps it is sin to set such store by them?</font><br>
 <font size="4pts" color="violet">Persome:</font>

 <font size="4pts" color="violet">Convict:</font>
<font size="4pts" color="saffron"> It’s been so long ago.... I forget; but I had a little cottage, there were vines growing on it. (Dreamily) They looked pretty with the evening sun on them,and, and.... there was a woman, she was (thinking hard), she must have been my wife-yes. (Suddenly and very rapidly). Yes, I remember! She was ill, we had no food, I could get no work, it was a bad year, and my wife, my Jeanette,was ill, dying (pause), so I stole to buy food for her. (Long pause. The Bishop gently pats his hand.) They caught me. I pleaded with them, I told them why I stole, but they laughed at me, and I was sentenced to ten years in the prison
hulks (pause), ten years in Hell. The night I was sentenced, the gaoler told me-told me Jeanette was dead. (Sobs with fury) Ah, damn them, damn them.God curse them all</font><br>

They took away my name, they took away my soul, and they gave me a devil in its place. But one day they were careless, one day they forgot to chain up their wild beast, and he escaped. He was free.
